barnowl-axis
============

__barnowl-axis__ converts [AXIS Object Analytics](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-object-analytics) messages from network cameras into standard developer-friendly JSON that is vendor/technology/application-agnostic.

![Overview of barnowl-axis](https://reelyactive.github.io/barnowl-axis/images/overview.png)

__barnowl-axis__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl-axis) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices as well as on powerful cloud servers and anything in between.  It is included in reelyActive's [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware suite, and can just as easily be run standalone behind a [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) instance, as detailed in the code examples below.


Quick Start
-----------

Clone this repository, install package dependencies with `npm install`, and then from the root folder run at any time:

    npm start

__barnowl-axis__ will attempt to connect to a local MQTT server localhost (mqtt://localhost) and subscribe to the Object Analytics topic, outputting processed messages as JSON to the console.


Hello barnowl-axis!
-------------------

Developing an application directly from __barnowl-axis__?  Start by pasting the code below into a file called server.js:

```javascript
const Barnowl = require('barnowl');
const BarnowlAxis = require('barnowl-axis');

let barnowl = new Barnowl({ enableMixing: true });

barnowl.addListener(BarnowlAxis, {}, BarnowlAxis.MqttListener,
                    { url: "mqtt://localhost" });

barnowl.on('infrastructureMessage', (infrastructureMessage) => {
  console.log(infrastructureMessage);
  // Trigger your application logic here
});
```

From the same folder as the server.js file, install package dependencies with the commands `npm install barnowl-axis` and `npm install barnowl`.  Then run the code with the command `node server.js` and observe infrastructureMessage objects output to the console:

```javascript
{
  deviceId: "b8a44f941234",
  deviceIdType: 2,
  isMotionDetected: [ true ],
  timestamp: 1645568542222
}
```

See the [Supported Listener Interfaces](#supported-listener-interfaces) below to adapt the code to listen for your network camera(s).


Supported Listener Interfaces
-----------------------------

The following listener interfaces are supported by __barnowl-axis__.  Extend the [Hello barnowl-axis!](#hello-barnowl-axis) example above by pasting in any of the code snippets below.

### MQTT

Connect to a MQTT server and subscribe to the Object Analytics topic to receive messages:

```javascript
let options = { url: "mqtt://localhost", clientOptions: { username: "user",
                                                          password: "pass" } }; 
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlAxis, {}, BarnowlAxis.MqttListener, options);
```

### Test

Provides periodic AXIS Object Analytics messages for testing purposes.

```javascript
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlAxis, {}, BarnowlAxis.TestListener, {});
```

Supported AXIS Object Analytics scenarios
-----------------------------------------

The following AXIS Object Analytics scenarios are supported:

| Scenario           | Decoded property  | Required scenario name |
|:-------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------|
| Object in area     | isMotionDetected  | n/a                    |
| Line crossing      | isMotionDetected  | n/a                    |
| Time in area       | isMotionDetected  | n/a                    |
| Crossline counting | passageCounts     | Crossline              |
| Occupancy in area  | numberOfOccupants | Occupancy              |

See the [advlib Standard Properties](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib/#standard-properties) for details of each decoded property.

![AXIS Object Analytics scenarios](https://reelyactive.github.io/barnowl-axis/images/object-analytics-scenarios.png)

Note that the Crossline counting scenario must be named _Crossline_ and the Occupancy in area scenario named _Occupancy_ in order for the corresponding messages to be decoded into `passageCounts` and `numberOfOccupants` properties, respectively.  The AXIS Object Analytics MQTT messages do not include a property to distinguish scenario type, and hence the user-defined name (included in the message as "scenario" property) is observed by __barnowl-axis__ to make this distinction.

![Named AXIS Object Analytics scenarios](https://reelyactive.github.io/barnowl-axis/images/named-scenarios.png)

The other scenarios require no naming constraints.  The messages for the other scenarios simply include an "active" property which is interpreted by __barnowl-axis__ as `isMotionDetected`.  It is therefore possible for two such scenarios to simultaneously produce contradictory `isMotionDetected` outputs.
